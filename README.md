This is two of the six labs done for TDP004 Object Oriented Programming. 
I chose these two because I enjoyed doing them.

*Circuits*
In actuality, we were not allowed to use smart pointers for
the circuit lab, but I redid the lab after turning it in to get
acquainted with smart pointers. 
It should also be mentioned that the circuit lab is just a simulation--
it is not meant to be an accurate portrayal of electronic circuits. 
Rather, I just followed the lab requirements. 

*Stack*
This lab is just an implementation of a stack data structure and
getting acquainted with templates.
